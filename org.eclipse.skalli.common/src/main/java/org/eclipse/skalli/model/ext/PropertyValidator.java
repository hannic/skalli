     * Checks whether the given value causes validation issues  equals to or more serious
     * than the given severity. The result set is sorted according to {@link Issue#compareTo(Issue)}.
     * <p>
     * A property validator <em>should</em> perform only those checks that are required or appropriate for
     * the given {@link Severity severity} level. The persistence service calls all property validators with
     * {@link Severity#FATAL} that are relevant for the properties of a certain entity to determine

     * <p>
     * Furthermore, property validators searching for {@link Severity#FATAL fatal} issues
     * <em>should not</em> perform time-consuming or potentially blocking operations,
     * such as contacting remote servers. Property validators are used, amongst others, in the UI to
     * check data entered by a user for fatal issues, e.g. missing or malformed URLs, and therefore
     * might be called frequently. In order to perserve a smooth user experience property
     * validators for fatal issues should perform the smallest possible set of checks only!
     * <p>
     * Implementations of this method must be thread-safe.

     * @throws ValidationException  if the validation failed.
